# MazeMaker
A custom 3D maze generator and explorer built in the Godot engine. The project uses Wilson's algorithmn, which produces
an unbiased maze at the cost of inconsistant performance at larger scale, and modifies it to apply to 3D space.

To install MazeMaker, simply download and extract the latest release, and launch 'MazeMaker.exe'.

To play, launch the application, click 'Host', adjust the size of the maze to your whim, and click play. WASD to move, Space and Control to move up and down.
